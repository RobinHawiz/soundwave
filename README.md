**The design comes from:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FK4YusHIIj0 (**DISCLAIMER!!** There is a video on how to code the website, but I didn't even take a glance at it because I wanted to do it on my own :))

Today it just really clicked for me. Everything just went smoothly and I finished the page! ðŸŽ‰ HTML/CSS is just starting to make more and more sense now, ex how to position elements, structuring layouts, SASS, css animations, flexing and wrapping elements, responsiveness, typography, media queries, fluidness, navbars, footers, using images as backgrounds and much much more. 

But I understand that this is just the beginning of my journey and that I for a fact just know a tiny little bit more than the average person. **A wise man once said: HTML/CSS is really easy to get into, but hard to master.**

And with that, I carry on ;)

Almost done with the homepage! Just need to figure out how to make the flex not make it so that the image pushes out the text after wrapping.

Got to implement what I learned from my previous project (personal webpage) and reinforce my knowledge around how to use svgâ€™s, so that was pretty cool I guess.

I also have a subgoal with this project, and that is to make it as fluid as possible (so no responsiveness).

Next up: navbar.
